    <h2>About Time Ride</h2>
    <h3>What is a Time Bank?</h3>
    <p>
      Time Banks have been established in 34 countries, with at least 300
      Time Banks established in 40 US states and 300 throughout the United
      Kingdom. Time Banks also have a significant presence in Japan,
      South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Senegal, Argentina, Israel, Greece,
      and Spain. Time Banks have been used to reduce recidivism rates with
      diversionary programs for first-time juvenile offenders; facilitate
      re-entry of for ex-convicts; deliver health care, job training and
      social services in public housing complexes; facilitate substance abuse
      recovery; prevent institutionalization of severely disabled children
      through parental support networks; provide transportation for
      homebound seniors in rural areas; deliver elder care, community health
      services and hospice care; and foster women's rights initiatives in
      Senegal.
    </p>
    <h3>What is timing banking?</h3>
    <p>
      Time banking is a pattern of reciprocal service exchange that uses
      units of time as currency.  It is an example of a complementary
      monetary system.  A time bank, also known as a service exchange,
      is a community that practices time banking. The unit of currency,
      always valued at an hour's worth of any person's labor, used by these
      groups has various names, but is generally known as a time dollar in
      the USA and a time credit in the UK.  Time banking is primarily used
      to provide incentives and rewards for work such as mentoring children,
      caring for the elderly, being neighborly—work usually done on a
      volunteer basis—which a pure market system devalues.  Essentially,
      the "time" one spends providing these types of community services
      earns "time" that one can spend to receive services.  As well as
      gaining credits, participating individuals, particularly those more
      used to being recipients in other parts of their lives, can potentially
      gain confidence, social contact and skills through giving to others.
      Communities therefore use time banking as a tool to forge stronger
      intra-community connections, a process known as "building social
      capital". Time banking had its intellectual genesis in the USA in the
      early 1980s. By 1990, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation had invested
      USD 1.2 million to pilot time banking in the context of senior care.
      Today, 26 countries have active Time Banks. There are 250 Time Banks
      active in the UK and over 276 Time Banks in the U.S.
    </p>
    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Time Banking is a community development tool and works by facilitating
      the exchange of skills and experience within a community. It aims to
      build the 'core economy' of family and community by valuing and
      rewarding the work done in it. The world's first time bank was started
      in Japan by Teruko Mizushima in 1973 with the idea that participants
      could earn time credits which they could spend any time during their
      lives. She based her bank on the simple concept that each hour of time
      given as services to others could earn reciprocal hours of services for
      the giver at some stage in the future, particularly in old age when
      they might need it most. In the 1940s, Mizushima had already foreseen
      the emerging problems of an ageing society such as seen today. In the
      1990s the movement took off in the USA, with Dr Edgar Cahn pioneering
      it there, and in the United Kingdom, with Martin Simon from
      Timebanking UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Edgar S. Cahn, time banking had its roots in a time when
      "money for social programs [had] dried up" and no dominant approach to
      social service in the U.S. was coming up with creative ways to solve
      the problem. He would later write that "Americans face at least three
      interlocking sets of problems: growing inequality in access by those
      at the bottom to the most basic goods and services; increasing social
      problems stemming from the need to rebuild family, neighborhood and
      community; and a growing disillusion with public programs designed to
      address these problems" and that "the crisis in support for efforts to
      address social problems stems directly from the failure of
      . . . piecemeal efforts to rebuild genuine community." In particular
      Cahn focused on the top-down attitude prevalent in social services.
      He believed that one of the major failings of many social service
      organizations was their unwillingness to enroll the help of those
      people they were trying to help. He called this a deficit based approach
      to social service, where organizations view the people they were
      trying to help only in terms of their needs, as opposed to an asset
      based approach, which focuses on the contributions towards their
      communities that everyone can make. He theorized that a system like
      time banking could "[rebuild] the infrastructure of trust and caring
      that can strengthen families and communities." He hoped that the
      system "would enable individuals and communities to become more
      self-sufficient, to insulate themselves from the vagaries of politics
      and to tap the capacity of individuals who were in effect being
      relegated to the scrap heap and dismissed as freeloaders."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a philosophy, time banking, also known as Time Trade is founded
      upon five principles, known as Time Banking's Core Values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone is an asset</li>
      <li>Some work is beyond a monetary price</li>
      <li>Reciprocity in helping</li>
      <li>Social networks are necessary</li>
      <li>A respect for all human beings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ideally, time banking builds community. Time Bank members sometimes
      refer to this as a return to simpler times when the community was there
      for its individuals. An interview at a time bank in the Gorbals
      neighbourhood of Glasgow revealed the following sentiment:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class='col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6'>
        [the time bank] involves everybody coming together as a community
        . . . the Gorbals has never — not for a long time — had a lot of
        community spirit. Way back, years ago, it had a lot of community
        spirit, but now you see that in some areas, people won't even go to
        the chap next door for a some sugar . . . that's what I think the
        project's doing, trying to bring that back, that community sense . . .
